24.
Neutrophils and macrophages are the most important leukocytes involved in phagocytosis.
25.
Leukocyte recruitment to sites of inflammation is a single-step process.
26.

29.
L-selectin is expressed on endothelial cells.
30.
Integrins on leukocytes are normally in a high-affinity state.
31.
Chemokines activate rolling leukocytes and increase the affinity of integrins.
32.
Transmigration, or diapedesis, of leukocytes occurs mainly in arterioles.
33.
Chemotaxis is the random movement of leukocytes.
34.
IL-8 is an example of an endogenous chemoattractant.
35.
In most forms of acute inflammation, monocytes predominate in the first 6 to 24 hours.
36.
Neutrophils are long-lived cells in tissues.
37.
In viral infections, lymphocytes may be the first cells to arrive at the site of inflammation.
38.
Phagocytosis involves recognition and attachment, engulfment, and degradation.
39.
Mannose receptors on macrophages recognize host cells effectively.
40.
Opsonization decreases the efficiency of phagocytosis.
41.
The fusion of a phagosome with a lysosomal granule forms a phagolysosome.
42.
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced by NADPH oxidase during the respiratory burst.
43.
Myeloperoxidase (MPO) converts hydrogen peroxide to superoxide anion.
44.
Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) is constitutively expressed at high levels in neutrophils.
45.
Lysosomal enzymes are only involved in extracellular degradation.
46.
Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are composed of mitochondrial DNA.
47.
Leukocytes can cause tissue injury under certain circumstances.
48.
The mechanisms by which leukocytes damage normal tissues are different from those used in antimicrobial defense.
49.
Apoptosis of neutrophils is one mechanism for the termination of inflammation.
50.
Anti-inflammatory cytokines like TGF-β and IL-10 help resolve inflammation.
